# tic-tac-toe

My 12th grade project for my boards...
A C++ program where you can play tic-tac-toe with another person in a GUI setting

# Background
The good old days where VSCode seemed to be out of bounds and turbo c++ was an emotion.
Its old C++, and requires the INCLUDE file for its functioning
